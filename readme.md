The application allows users to share rides on a route. Users can use either offer (Driver) or take (Passenger) a shared ride. 
Users can search for and choose from various available rides on a route with the same origin and destination. 
If the user’s origin/destinations aren’t directly accessible but can be reached via several rides, the app will find multiple rides.
